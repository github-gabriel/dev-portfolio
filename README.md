## Overview

I created a basic portfolio website with a code and console tab style to align with the theme of a development portfolio. The website is built using pure CSS, HTML, and JS. I've incorporated a Reset CSS (normalize.css) to ensure consistency across different browsers.

The main purpose of this project is to provide information about me, my current coding progress, and my future plans. It includes details about the projects I've worked on, and I also share my aspirations, such as the programming languages or topics I plan to learn in the future.
